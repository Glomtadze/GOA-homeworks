        <p>Shutter Island is a 2010 psychological thriller directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The story follows U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels as he investigates the disappearance of a patient from a mental institution on a remote island, only to uncover shocking truths about himself. The film is known for its dark atmosphere, intense performances, and twist ending.I like Shutter Island because it has a very surprising ending and keeps me interested the whole time.</p>
